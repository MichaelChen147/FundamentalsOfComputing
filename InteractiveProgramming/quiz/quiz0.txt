Question 7
Which of the following can be used as a variable name?

Try using each in CodeSkulptor.

Your Answer		Score	Explanation
16ounces	Correct	1.00	No, this is not a valid variable name. A variable name cannot begin with digits.
__number__	Correct	2.00	
This is a valid variable name. However, convention says that Python variable names starting and ending with underscores only in special circumstances.

ounces	Correct	2.00	This is a valid variable name.
my.number	Correct	1.00	
No, this is not a valid variable name. While a name can contain a period, it is considered a compound of two names, not a single name. The first part is the name of a module or class, as we will see later. The second part is the name of a variable or function.

MYnumber	Correct	2.00	
This is a valid variable name. However, convention says that Python variables shouldn't start with a capital letter.

my_number	Correct	2.00	
This is a valid variable name., You can use underscores.
